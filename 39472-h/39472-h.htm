  <p>As far as I can ascertain, this beautifully coloured bird is quite
  new, and hitherto undescribed. It is in the possession of Mr. Leadbeater,
  of Brewer Street, by whom it was received from New Zealand; and who gave
  me the opportunity of now publishing the accompanying figure and
  description.</p>

  <p>The two extreme points of difference in the Linnæan kingfishers, are
  seen in the <i>Alcedo Ispida</i>, and <i>A. <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'gigantia', see Addenda et Corrigenda"
  >gigantea</span></i>; the last of which has been made into the genus
  <i>Dacelo</i>. It will, nevertheless, be found, that from among the birds
  left in the old genus, there are a great number, (of which, indeed, this
  bird is a striking example,) which are much nearer allied to
  <i>Dacelo</i> than to <i>Alcedo</i>, where they now stand. It will
  appear, therefore, more natural to consider <i>Halcyon</i> and
  <i>Dacelo</i> as one genus&mdash;which may be called by either name, but
  which must be distinguished by the characters herein given to
  <i>Halcyon</i>, inasmuch as the generic definition of <i>Dacelo</i>
  (founded on one bird) will be found too restricted to comprehend all.</p>

  <p>Total length ten inches; bill two and a half from the gape, and one
  and a half from the nostrils; the tip of the upper mandible with a slight
  inclination downwards, and with an appearance of a notch; the whole head,
  neck, and under plumage, of a delicate fawn colour; under wing covers the
  same; the remaining upper plumage, with the wings and tail, changeable
  blue green; ears sea green and dusky, united to a narrow black nuchal
  collar; wings four inches long, and the tail, which is even, three and a
  quarter; the hind head is slightly crested, and the feet pale brown.</p>

  <p>The Linnæan Barbuts, comprehended by Latham under one genus, contain
  three distinct groups of birds; which, from their peculiar characters, no
  less than their geographic position, have now received generic
  distinctions. The first of these (which are still retained under the old
  genus,) are natives of Asia; the next in affinity were first
  characterized by Illiger under the name of <i>Pogonias</i>, and are
  distributed on the African continent; while the prototype genus in
  America is <i>Tamatia</i> (Cuvier), in which continent not any of the two
  preceding have been found: thus each quarter of the globe lying within
  the tropics have their corresponding groups of a family, possessing a
  general, but at the same time an individuality of character.</p>

  <p>I am obliged to Mr. Leadbeater for the opportunity of figuring this
  new and rare species, which he believes to have come from Sierra Leone.
  Its total length was six inches; the under-covers of the wings white; the
  tail two inches long, the feathers broad and even.</p>

  <p>The beautiful little Butterflies included by Fabricius in this genus,
  are scattered over all parts of the world, but are most numerous within
  the tropics, and particularly in South America, for in Brazil alone I
  collected near 120 species. They are an obvious and very natural family,
  though the species are as yet but little understood, and not one half of
  them described. I have observed a singular peculiarity in a great many of
  these insects, which is, that when they are at rest in the sun, the lower
  wings are constantly in a quick vibrating motion up and down, as if the
  insect was rubbing them together, more particularly where the two lobes
  (or obtuse tails) of the under wings meet, though what purpose this is
  intended to accomplish remains unknown.</p>

  <p>The upper surface of the wings in the greatest number of the <i>Hair
  streaks</i> (as they are aptly called by English collectors) are of
  various shades of vivid blue, so that the species can only be ascertained
  from the under markings, which are usually very striking and delicate:
  they are all of a small size.</p>

  <p>This is an African species, and both sexes are in the cabinet of my
  friend Mr. Haworth.</p>

  <p>Though this is not an uncommon Shell, it is rarely seen so large as
  that now represented from the cabinet of Mrs. Bolton of Storrs. Of this
  extensive genus Lamarck has written a valuable account in the Annals of
  the French Museum, where he has rightly pointed out the mistake of Gmelin
  in placing as varieties of this species, one or two other very distinct
  shells: the colour of the bands is not always certain, for I have seen
  specimens in which they were of a dark brown; but the very thick spire,
  and slender form of the body whirl, with the distant, regular, and
  greatly elevated striæ, <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'renders', see Addenda et Corrigenda"
  >render</span> it a species not easily mistaken, though in general form
  it comes very near to <i>C. nussatella</i>, and two or three others; the
  spiral volutions are deeply concave, and the tip and base tinged with
  violet.</p>

  <p>It is a native of the Indian seas.</p>

  <p>The specific distinction given by Linnæus to <i>Strombus <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'urseus', see Addenda et Corrigenda"
  >urceus</span></i> is so loose, that his followers have referred all the
  small species of this genus to the numerous varieties he has quoted,
  though few will doubt that many permanent species have been thus
  overlooked; among these the one now characterized is an example, the most
  striking distinctions of which are in the spire being never plaited, and
  always much shorter than the mouth, which latter is either nearly white,
  or of a flesh colour; in its external colouring no two specimens will be
  found alike. It is not an uncommon shell from the East Indies, and seldom
  grows larger than the figure.</p>

  <p>I have before observed, that this genus of birds was first
  characterized under the name of <i>Pogonias</i>, by Illiger, in 1811;
  some years after (1815), M. Vieillot changed the name to <i>Pogonia</i>,
  without taking any notice of Illiger's denomination, and Dr. Leach has
  followed Vieillot without probably being aware of the plagiarism;
  Vieillot's name must, however, be expunged, as Mr. Brown has some time
  back affixed the name of <i>Pogonia</i> to a remarkable genus of
  plants.</p>

  <p>Total length about seven inches; bill blueish black, one inch two
  lines long, and large in proportion; the tooth in the middle very
  prominent; behind the eye is a short white stripe, and another much
  longer begins from the under mandible, and goes half way down the neck;
  the chin and part of the throat, together with the head and neck above,
  deep black, which changes to a dark brown on the back, wings, covers, and
  tail; a small round sulphur spot is on the tip of each feather of the
  hind head, back, and lesser wing covers; the quills pale brown, margined
  with sulphur; the under plumage is greenish sulphur, closely spotted with
  blackish; the most extraordinary peculiarity of this bird consists in the
  feathers of the breast, which are more rigid than the others, pointed,
  and the shaft of the lower ones ending in fine incurved setaceous hairs,
  many of which are near an inch long. The probable use this particular
  formation is intended for, it is impossible to conjecture.</p>

  <p>Mr. B. Leadbeater, to whom I am often obliged for the inspection of
  rare subjects, received this from Africa, and it is the only individual

  <p>It is impossible to represent this superbly coloured little creature
  in its full beauty, though the figure will not be found very defective.
  The only representation of the male is in the Naturalist's Miscellany,
  where it cannot be recognized, and Le Vaillant's is of the female, which
  differs considerably from the other sex. It is a rare species, and
  peculiar to New Holland.</p>

  <p>Length nine inches, with the tail, which is near four inches and a
  half; the upper part of the plumage olive green, not so bright as is
  usual in this tribe; the front of the head is a most brilliant turcosine
  blue, which spreads on the cheeks, nearly to the ears, and then mixes
  with the green; the shoulders and lesser wing covers of the same colour,
  graduating to a deep mazarine blue on the greater covers, spurious wings,
  and quill feathers, which latter are all deep black beneath, as well as
  on their interior shafts; at the base of the shoulders is a large
  irregular patch of dull red, partially hid by the scapulars; the under
  plumage is yellow, tinged with olive on the throat and breast, and
  verging towards orange on the belly; tail feathers narrow and pointed,
  mostly green, with the inner shafts blueish, and margined with black; the
  three outer on each side nearly yellow, the next tipt only with that
  colour; under the wings brilliant blue, the greater covers and quills
  deep black; bill very small; upper mandible without a notch, and
  blackish; lower very convex, and, with the legs, flesh colour.</p>

  <p>The female figured by Le Vaillant is much less brilliant in all its
  colours, and without the red mark on the shoulders.</p>

  <p>Having figured two or three species allied to this shell, it appears
  advisable to subjoin a more particular notice of it, and to point out
  those characters by which it may be detected through its numerous
  variations: this has been endeavoured in the specific character now
  formed, and appears to rest principally on the inner lip, which is always
  semicircular, down which, if closely examined inside, there is a
  depression as if it had been pared down with a knife; the base of the
  pillar also is so strongly truncated as to appear notched, and the
  broadest part of the mouth is always in the middle; these characters have
  been very ill attended to in all the figures above quoted, of which Seba
  gives no less than eleven, which vary only in the disposition and number
  of their bands.</p>

  <p>Gualtieri's figure at <i>tab.</i> 6. <i>fig.</i> D, is an admirable
  representation of <i>A. pallida</i>, which, not having his work before me
  at the time, I could not quote; the other at C is a very good one of the
  present shell. The upper drawing is from one in my own cabinet; the lower
  is in the possession of Mr. C. Dubois, who is continually adding to his
  fine and valuable collection.</p>

  <p>It is almost unnecessary to contradict the opinion of some writers who
  have fancied this a <i>fresh-water</i> shell. It is not uncommon, but
  seldom seen in perfection.</p>

  <p>The Shells of this genus are composed of such of the Linnæan
  <i>Nerits</i> as are umbilicated, from which latter they essentially
  differ, both in the organization of the animal and the construction of
  the shell, which is either closed by a shelly or horny operculum.</p>

  <p>The species are numerous, and are found both in temperate and tropical
  seas; two or three inhabit our own coasts, but by far the greater number
  are found in the Asiatic Ocean. They are subject to variation in their
  colour; and this, joined with a general resemblance in form, has rendered
  the discrimination of the species very difficult. I have, however,
  remarked, that the various modifications of the umbilicus, and the
  termination of the pillar (which is indicated in many species by an
  elevated ridge or rib within the umbilicus) is a certain and constant
  indication, presenting the same peculiarity through all the individuals
  of a species, even in the young state. This termination of the pillar has
  been mistaken for the inner lip, which, on the contrary, is always above
  the umbilicus, which, if closed, is not closed by the lip, but by the
  thickened termination of the pillar or columella.</p>

  <p>The two most striking varieties are here figured of this species,
  which is sufficiently described in the specific character. I believe it
  is found both in the Mediterranean and Red Seas.</p>

  <p>This Bird was pointed out to me by Professor Temminck as described by

  this authority, therefore, I have been obliged to rest, for I have in
  vain turned over the catalogues of all the public libraries in the
  metropolis, in the hope of seeing the work, and ascertaining the fact.
  The book is modern, and, though expensive, one of standard excellence;
  but a princely fortune is necessary to purchase such a library as a
  student should have access to.</p>

  <p>Total length eight inches and a half; size rather less than the common
  bee-eater; the crown in young birds is greenish, in some a dull brown,
  and in others deep black, margined in the front and sides of the head
  with a line of white; the ears black, uniting to a broad band across the
  neck of the same colour, which is margined on the lower part with
  beautiful sea blue; the nape of the neck, inner covers, and quill
  feathers, greenish fawn colour; the lesser quills tipt with black; the
  rump, tail, and outside of the quills next the body changeable greenish
  blue; the back and upper covers green beneath; the chin is white; the
  body tinged with greenish, and the under tail covers with blue: the tail
  three inches long, and in such specimens as have the two middle feathers
  lengthened, three and a half; bill and feet black.</p>

  <p>There appears no end to the immense number of species referrible to
  this genus, which will perhaps be found the most extensive tropical group
  of all the Linnæan <i>Phalænidæ.</i> Of these, near eighty species I
  found in Brazil; Dr. Horsfield has brought a great many from Java; near
  fifty are found in North America, and I have little doubt that the whole
  number existing in the cabinets which I have inspected may amount to
  about three hundred and fifty. The thorough investigation of these is a
  work of no ordinary labour; and, until this is done, it appears most
  advisable to let the generic distinction remain, as given by Latreille,
  though there can be no doubt that among them distinct groups will be

  <p>The Ear-shells are strangely characterized by their peculiarity of
  form, perforated holes, and rich pearly interior. They are found in both
  temperate and tropical seas; but the definitions hitherto given by
  conchologists are so imperfect, that they have left our knowledge of
  these shells nearly the same now, as in the time of Linnæus. Seventeen
  species only are enumerated in Mr. Dillwyn's work; although thirty-four
  have fallen within my own observation the last few months.</p>

  <p>The difference between this and the common black Californian Ear,
  consists in its being a much deeper and smoother shell, always narrowest
  at the base, the outer lip not having (as in that) a prominent curve or
  gibbosity where it joins the spire; but principally in the perforations,
  which in this are always half as large, and doubly numerous; it is also
  generally a much smaller, and less common species: the spire is always
  deeply tinged with pink. The genus <i>Padollus</i>, of Montford, resting
  entirely in the unevenness of the outer lip, without any knowledge of the
  animal, appears to me an unnecessary distinction, for such is the
  character of all young shells, and also of mature ones, whose outer
  surface is rugged or uneven.</p>

  <p>It is in all things better to understand few subjects well than many
  imperfectly; knowledge may be extensive, but it cannot be sound, if it is
  at the same time imperfect; and, applying this observation to the present
  article, it becomes as desirable, where necessary, to illustrate an
  insect known to Linnæus, as to regard only the accession of new
  species.</p>

  <p>The two insects figured were received from Jamaica by my friend Dr.
  Leach, and there can be no doubt they are the sexes of one species. The
  upper is a male, and agrees with Drury's figure and description; the
  lower insect is a female, of which no representation has been published:
  as for Cramer's figure, if intended for the former, it is really so bad
  that it can hardly be quoted as an authority, and it appears to have
  misled Fabricius, in thinking that the female insect had a brown stripe
  on the anterior wings, whereas that character is more applicable to the
  male.</p>

  <p>The insects I propose retaining under this genus are such as have the
  body lengthened, pointed, and not bearded at the tip; the antennæ but
  slightly thickened in the middle, and the terminating hook gradual,
  arched, and not very acute: these comprehend the first section of
  Latreille's genus, <i>Sphinx</i>, and are by him again divided into two
  groups, the one having the wings entire, the other angulated.</p>

  <p>Like the resplendent jewels of the earth, the Humming Birds are the
  living gems of the air. United to the most delicate form, these fairies
  of creation have the dazzling effulgence of every tint that sparkles from
  the ruby, the topaz, the sapphire, and the emerald, lavished on their
  plumage; they seem created but for our admiration, to sport in the ardent
  beams of a tropical sun, and to feast on the nectar of the sweetest
  blossoms; and, like sparks of many coloured fire, they shoot from flower
  to flower, exulting in their little life of brightness and pleasure.</p>

  <p>To return, however, to that now before us, it should be observed, that
  it is the only species whose plumage does not in any way accord with that
  of the rest of its brethren. No author appears to have described it,
  although I met with it very frequently in Brazil: a specimen in the
  British Museum has the ears reddish brown, but this seldom occurs. The
  figure is of the size of life. All the species are natives of tropical
  America.</p>

  <p>Nothing can exceed the dazzling brilliancy of colours united in this
  little creature. It is, however, more remarkable from the extraordinary
  construction of its wings, the outer quills of which are greatly curved,
  and the shafts dilated to a most disproportionate size; a similar
  structure occurs also in the Broad-shafted H. B. of Dr. Shaw, (<i>T.
  latipennis</i>.) That it is intended to fulfil some important office in
  their economy, will admit of no doubt, for in wisdom are all things made;
  conjecture must, however, in numberless instances, supply our want of
  real knowledge; and it may not be improbable that such additional
  strength in the wings has been given them as a defence against the small
  birds of prey, (<i>Lanii.</i> Lin.) which abound in tropical
  countries.</p>

  <p>The figure is the size of life; bill curved from the base, with a
  black stripe between that and the eye; plumage above deep shining green,
  most brilliant on the sides of the neck; ear feathers blue green; chin
  and throat of a most brilliant deep violet blue, changing in some lights
  to purple, becoming greenish on the breast, and blended with the green of
  the neck; all these feathers are disposed like scales; vent golden green,
  with two tufts of downy white feathers round the thighs. Tail even, the
  feathers broad and truncately rounded, of a rufous cinnamon colour, tipt
  with a purple black bar; the middle feathers darkest, and glossed with
  green.</p>

  <p>Of this rare and unrecorded species, a fine example existed in Mr.
  Bullock's Museum, which was purchased to enrich that of Paris: another,
  more imperfect, was sent Mr. Falkner from the Spanish Main. The male of
  <i>T. latipennis</i> is undescribed, Dr. Shaw having only seen the
  female; both sexes, however, are in my possession. The plant introduced
  in the plate (<i>Clitoria Plumieri</i>) is a native of Brazil.</p>

  where they principally live. Gmelin remarks that the animal emits a
  phosphoric light; and Captain Cook observed that it is oviparous, and
  discharged, on being touched, a liquor of the most beautiful purple. Dr.
  Turton and Mr. Dillwyn have recorded several British localities for this
  shell; and the former notes having seen it alive, but without giving any

  such, that, although common, it is very rarely seen so perfect as here

  <p>The Cones are remarkable both for their beauty and the very high value
  attached to many of the varieties. They are likewise a very numerous
  family, and, with three or four exceptions, are all inhabitants of
  tropical latitudes, particularly the Indian Ocean. Bruguière and Lamarck
  have each written very able descriptions of the species, of which the
  latter enumerates 179 recent, and 9 found only in a fossil state.</p>

  <p>This is a shell of great rarity and beauty. Dead and injured specimens
  are often seen, in which the deep reddish brown colour is bleached to a
  pale rose, and the base worn round. Of the live shell I have never seen
  more than two or three; and the finest of these is here figured from Mr.
  Dubois' cabinet: it is a native of the Asiatic Ocean.</p>

  <p>I see no reason why the original name of Linnæus for this shell should
  have been changed, although, under it, he has evidently included other
  species quite distinct; (his var. <span class="grk">&beta;</span> being
  <i>C. ebræus</i>): indeed, it too often happens, that in making those
  alterations absolutely necessary in the present state of the science, the
  spirit of innovation oversteps the justice due to those, whose labours
  first laid the foundation of our own knowledge.</p>

  <p>Linnæus has well observed, that the great distinctions of his three
  genera of Lepidoptera, were, that Butterflies are seen on the wing only
  during the day; Hawk-moths, or Sphinxes, at the rising and setting of the
  sun; and Moths during the night. The insects of Europe, indeed, offer but
  few exceptions to these characters; but the habits of certain exotic
  tribes, in each of these families, partake both of one and the other in a
  remarkable manner. Thus, among the butterflies, there is a genus in South
  America (hitherto unnoticed), which fly only during the dusk of evening:
  a number of the Linnæan Hawk-moths prefer the meridian heat of the sun;
  and there are not wanting several moths which are only seen during the
  same period of the day.</p>

  <p>The insect, however, before us, is of that tribe to which the remark
  of Linnæus is strictly applicable; and, although included in the
  <i>Systema Naturæ</i>, has remained without any correct representation,
  for it would be difficult to delineate a worse figure of it than that
  given by Cramer. Besides the row of five snowy white spots on each side
  of the body, there are four pair of others, more dusky, down the middle,
  and five small black dots near the outer margin of the fore wings; the
  colour of all beneath is a buff yellow, with two faint dusky oblique
  bars, and the middle of the fore wings sea green.</p>

  <p>I have received this species from Jamaica; in its larva state it
  appears to feed on the wild vine.</p>

  <p>It is not improbable that <i>Mitra bifasciata</i>, (<i>Zool. Ill.</i>
  <i>pl.</i> 35.) may eventually be considered only a variety of the shell
  here figured, which accords much closer with the characters given of the
  Linnæan <i>M. caffra</i>, than any other; the two shells, however, at the
  first glance, have a widely different appearance; yet not more so, than
  the smooth and plaited varieties of <i>Strombus vittatus Lin.</i> I have
  therefore retained the character given by Lamarck, as the best method to
  be followed in doubtful cases. In this shell, the plaits commence halfway
  round the body whirl; they are obtuse, crowded, and not angulated near
  the suture; the striæ between are fine and decidedly marked; the base
  half of the shell strongly grooved; the suture rather compressed; the
  channel short and not recurved, and the aperture striated.</p>

  <p>Those of our readers who visited Leamington during the last season,
  may have observed this noisy little creature uttering its discordant
  cries at the door of a small house near the pump-room. I borrowed it for
  a day from the good woman to whom it belonged, and thus made the drawing
  and description with the bird before me.</p>

  <p>Dr. Latham observes on this species, that excepting where the grey
  colour pervades, "the rest of the body is olive green, excepting the
  quills, which are deep green;"&mdash;this may be the female. He adds a
  quotation from Pernetty, who describes a bird from Monte Video, something
  near this; but which, from having a very long tail, a flesh-coloured
  bill, &amp;c. may probably be distinct.</p>

  <p>The live bird could not be conveniently measured, but it is rather
  larger than the red-shouldered Parrakeet, (figured at pl. 62.) The skin
  round the eye white, and the irides hazel; the whole upper part of the
  plumage is a beautiful grass green, changing according to the light into
  different shades; the top of the head, the quill feathers, and end of the
  tail, greenish blue, in some lights appearing quite blue; the sides of
  the head, ears, and throat, as far as the breast, bluish grey; all the
  remaining under plumage yellowish green, with a shade of orange in the
  middle of the body and vent; bill and legs dark grey; this latter colour
  is so unusual in this tribe, that I at first thought it indicated an
  imperfect plumage, but I have now seen it at two different seasons of the
  year without any variation whatever. It is probably a South American
  species.</p>

  <p>I was put in possession of this rare and unknown bird, by the
  dispersion of the most magnificent assemblage of natural productions that
  ever marked the zeal of an individual, or ornamented the capital of this
  kingdom. Mr. Bullock's Museum is now scattered; yet the objects it
  comprised were deemed worthy of enriching the public repositories of
  every nation in Europe; who sent their learned men to purchase with
  avidity, and share in the spoils of a Museum, the dispersion of which
  will be long regretted by the learned, the inquiring, and "the many."</p>

  <p>Total length, twelve inches and a half; bill, from the angle of the
  mouth to the tip, two inches three tenths long, and eight tenths across
  the base; the colour (which appears little changed from that in the live
  state) is deep straw, or buff yellow; the top of the upper mandible and
  tips of both are black; parallel with the marginal base of the upper, is
  a black line, which is very broad on that of the lower; the edges of both
  are serrated, and marked by short black lines, somewhat resembling
  oriental characters; at the base of the bill there is an elevated rim of
  deeper yellow; the ears, chin, and throat are deep chesnut, margined in
  front with a narrow line of black, (which parts in the male are entirely
  black;) the crown of the head and neck above also black, changing to a
  dark bluish green on the wings, back, and tail; the rump crimson, and the
  greater quills blackish; from the breast to the vent straw-coloured
  yellow, with a greenish cast; the thighs and flanks olive; tail wedged,
  near five inches long; the orbits appear to have been black, and the feet
  green.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bullock informed me he had the two sexes of this bird sent him
  from the interior of Guyana.</p>

  <p>This is the only species among those I have united under the genus
  <i>Licinia</i>, which has any shade of red mixed in the colouring, all
  the others being variegated only with white, yellow, and black. It is a
  native of Brazil, <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'and Godart mentions', see Addenda et Corrigenda"
  >and according to Godart</span> of Guyana and the Antilles: though not
  common, it is sometimes frequent in local situations, preferring the
  borders of deep forests, and flying very slowly. I had the means of fully
  ascertaining the two sexes, of which the two upper figures are of the
  male, and the lower one the female. There can be no doubt the latter is
  the <i>Pieris Amphione</i>, so admirably described by M. Godart, who,
  however, makes no mention of the black marginal spots on the under side
  of the posterior wings, represented in Cramer's figure, which may
  therefore be a variety. More difficulty, however, exists in ascertaining
  if the male is distinct from <i>P. Laia</i>, of Godart: the figures of
  Cramer, in general, are so inaccurate, as always to excite a doubt in
  cases of nice discrimination; Godart's description, nevertheless,
  perfectly agrees with Cramer's figure: if it was, therefore, drawn up
  from the insect itself, there can be little doubt that <i>Laia</i> is
  distinct from <i>Amphione</i>; if, on the other hand, M. Godart made his
  description only from Cramer's figure, the question remains in its
  original uncertainty.</p>

  <p>The club of the antennæ is white, tipt with pale brown. The under side
  of the female very closely resembles the upper, excepting that the black
  stripe on the lower wings is broken; and there are irregular blotches of
  white at the tips of both wings, but no marginal spots, as represented by
  Cramer.</p>

  <p>It will be found that <i>Licinia</i> is the connecting genus between
  those of <i>Danais</i> and <i>Pieris</i>, of Latreille, and that the
  transition between the last of these and <i>Colias</i> is strongly marked
  by that of Terias, (<i>Zool. Ill. pl.</i> 22).</p>

  <p>What with the inaccuracy of figures, and the almost universal neglect
  with which the most eminent entomologists have passed over this beautiful
  order, the natural arrangement and affinities of the <i>Lepidoptera</i>
  still remain in the greatest obscurity; and it is recommended to those
  who may object to the additional generic distinctions I have made, to
  examine, in the first instance, the relative validity they bear in
  essential character to the innumerable genera that are continually
  created in the <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Hymenoptera</i>, and
  <i>Diptera</i>.</p>

  <p>From the earliest ages, the Butterfly appears to have attracted the
  admiration of mankind; and we find it celebrated by their poets as
  figurative of gaiety and pleasure, and by their sages as an emblem of the
  human soul. It has been interwoven in one of their most beautiful
  allegories, and has been consecrated in our own days by several poets,
  though by none with such exquisite taste and moral feeling, as by the
  venerable Historian of the <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Medicii', see Addenda et Corrigenda"
  >Medici</span>.</p>

  <p>So few of those insects, generally called Butterflies, were known to
  Linnæus, that he included them all in one genus, dividing them, for the
  most part, into natural groups. Fabricius continued this arrangement,
  with little variation, and has left us the description of near 1,150
  species! Yet before his death, this laborious naturalist saw the absolute
  necessity of dividing this immense genus into many others, and left among
  his MSS. a sketch of his proposed arrangement, published afterwards by
  Illiger, and partially adopted (we venture to think also very
  imperfectly) by M. Latreille.</p>

  <p>The insects which are therefore now left under the old genus
  <i>Papilio</i>, are principally found out of Europe, and are remarkable
  for their richness of colouring and immense size. M. M. Latreille and
  Godart have described, with great precision, 146 species: it is, however,
  to be regretted, that they have adopted no sections or divisions to
  assist the student in his search after any particular species, among this
  extensive number. The great disadvantage of this is very obvious, and it
  has induced me to attempt something like a natural distribution of those
  insects, which, with every care to avoid an unnatural separation of
  kindred groups, I am fully aware, in some cases, is very artificial, and
  it is only offered until a greater knowledge of the larvæ, &amp;c. will
  enable us to fix on more substantial characters than those I have
  adopted. This, however, will be a work of time; and until then, I think
  some guide to the ready knowledge of the species, however objectionable,
  is better than none.</p>

  <p>Much might be said on the affinities which connect this with several
  other genera. Among the most striking is that existing between them and
  the <i>Noctuæ</i> (<i>N. Patroclus</i> Fab.) by means of <i>Pap.
  Leilus</i> Lin. which thus stands between the night and the day-flying
  <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Lepidopteræ', see Addenda et Corrigenda (Vol. III)"
  >Lepidoptera</span>. Many of the insects placed in our division of
  <i>Græci caudati</i>, are allied to <i><span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Danais', see Addenda et Corrigenda"
  >Danaus</span></i> Lat. by the larva of both having retractile hornshaped
  processes, and the two genera seem still further connected by <i>Papilio
  similis</i> and <i>dissimilis</i> in one group, and by <i>P. Priamus</i>
  in the other; while the clear winged species from New Holland seem to
  indicate an affinity with the <i>Heliconiæ</i>.</p>

  <p>The laborious and important investigations of M. Savigny into the
  structure of the mouth of these insects are too well known, to require a
  more particular notice in this slight sketch of the subject.</p>

  <p>M. Godart has anticipated me in the first publication of this, and a
  great many other newly discovered Brazilian insects; it has, however, not
  been figured; and I take this opportunity of expressing my doubts,
  whether this and the next are not sexes of the same species, rather than
  two, permanently distinct. I have not, at this particular time, the means
  of referring either to my notes or my collections, by which the
  recollection I have on the subject might be in some way confirmed; and,
  until this is done, it is much better retaining the two insects as
  distinct species: the figures of both will show their very close

  <p>It is singular that Fabricius appears to have overlooked this species,
  sufficiently well figured by Cramer to point out its leading characters,
  though very inferior to the beauty of the insect. M. Godart has, however,
  recorded it in his account of this superb genus in the <i>Encyclopédie
  Méthodique</i>; and the minute and clear descriptions which this able
  entomologist has given throughout that work, merit the highest eulogium.
  Our own figures will, however, render a detailed description in this
  place unnecessary.</p>

  <p>M. Godart says, this insect is found both in Guiana and Brazil. In the
  latter country, I met with it only in the province of Rio de Janeiro,
  where it is common.</p>

  <p>This splendid family may be considered as the Humming-birds of the old
  world, inhabiting (I think exclusively) the tropical regions of Africa
  and Asia. To the personal observations of M. Vaillant we owe the first,
  and indeed the only detailed account, of their real economy, and which
  this enterprising ornithologist remarked during his travels in Africa,
  and published in his work on the birds of that continent; a work which
  will be valued and consulted when most of the systems framed by closet
  naturalists will be forgotten.</p>

  <p>M. Vaillant records a singular fact respecting these birds: which is,
  that the males only assume their rich and vivid colours during the season
  of courtship; at other times they are scarcely to be known from the
  females, whose plumage in general is very plain. Another bird, very
  nearly resembling this, has been figured by M. Vaillant under the name of
  <i>Le Sucrier à Plastron rouge</i> (Ois. d'Af. pl. 300.); his reasons,
  however, for separating them, are, I think, sufficient, at least until
  more forcible ones are adduced than mere conjecture. Our figure is the
  size of life; on each side the breast is a tuft of yellow feathers; the
  back, neck, and head shining golden green, changing in various lights.
  The female is said to be the <i>Certhia Capensis</i> of Lin., which is
  greyish brown above, and paler beneath.</p>

  <p>The different generic names which have been given to these birds by
  modern systematic writers, require some elucidation. They were originally
  placed by Linnæus among the <i>Certhiæ</i>; out of this genus Illiger
  formed another by the name of <i>Nectarinia</i>, in which he included not
  only these birds, but many others allied to them. From this genus of
  Illiger's, Cuvier separated a part under the generic appellation of
  <i>Cinnyris</i>, a genus which comprised those species of Illiger's
  <i>Nectarinia</i> only which are found in the parallels of latitude of
  the old world. So far these changes can be understood; but Professor
  Temminck, without noticing this previous arrangement, places the birds
  belonging to Cuvier's genus <i>Cinnyris</i>, under his own modification
  of Illiger's <i>Nectarinia</i>, while to the <i><span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Nectarinia', see Addenda et Corrigenda"
  >Nectariniæ</span></i>, as characterized by Cuvier, he gives the generic
  name of <i>C&oelig;reba</i>. This last change has introduced great
  confusion; for the student must bear in mind, that Cuvier's genus
  <i>Nectarinia</i> corresponds to Temminck's <i>C&oelig;reba</i>; that
  <i>Cinnyris</i> of Cuvier is <i>Nectarinia</i> of Temminck; and finally,
  that all these are included under Illiger's original genus
  <i>Nectarinia</i>! M. Vieillot has still further added to this
  unfortunate multiplicity of names, by giving that of <i>Mellisuga</i> to
  Cuvier's <i>Cinnyris</i>. This may truly be termed a war of words. In the
  meantime, as Cuvier was the first who, by giving the name of
  <i>Cinnyris</i>, designated the <i>Sucriers</i> of Vaillant, and those
  <i>only</i>, his definition and generic name to these birds should
  unquestionably supersede all others.</p>

  <p>The shells now arranged under the kindred genera of <i>Unio</i> and
  <i>Anodon</i> are exclusively fluviatile, or inhabitants of fresh water,
  and are dispersed both in the old and the new world. In the Linnæan
  system, the first, being furnished with teeth, are placed among the
  <i>Myæ</i>; and the latter, from having none, are arranged with the
  <i>Mytili</i>. Two common shells, in our own rivers and ponds (<i>Mya
  pictorum</i>, and <i>Mytilus anatinus Lin.</i>), will readily present to
  the student the characters by which they are severally distinguished. The
  shells of the present genus bear such a general resemblance to each
  other, and are so simple in their construction, that a corresponding
  minuteness of discrimination is requisite to characterize the species; I
  have, therefore, selected for this purpose the modification of the upper
  margin to which the ligament is attached, and which in other shells forms
  the bases of the teeth. This I have termed the hinge margin. The form of
  the notch or sinus which terminates this part will also be found of much
  importance in discriminating the species; for no shells vary more in
  their form, thickness, or convexity than these do, according to their
  locality, age, or other circumstances.</p>

  <p>Shell transverse, oval; rather thick and ventricose; both extremities
  obtuse; the anterior side (from the umbones to the exterior margin)
  obliquely rounded; umbones prominent; hinge margin rather thick, slightly
  curved, and swelled immediately under the umbones; sinus short, abrupt,
  curved; epidermis coarse, black, and much wrinkled; inside stained with
  yellow, and having a narrow reddish rim or margin.</p>

  <p>For this species, now, I believe, first made known, I am indebted to
  G. C. Bainbridge, Esq. of Liverpool, who received several specimens from
  the United States. It appears to have been unknown to Mr. Say, who has
  published an account of the land and river shells of North America.</p>

  <p>The student might be led to suppose, that the two genera of
  <i>Unio</i> and <i>Anodon</i> are strongly characterized; for the first
  includes many of the most ponderous bivalves yet discovered, and the
  second some remarkably thin and brittle. Among the <i>Uniones</i> are
  shells furnished with hinges of the greatest force, while most of the
  <i>Anodons</i> are perfectly destitute of any; nevertheless, the
  gradations by which these characters approach each other are very
  remarkable, and some shells which partake of both have been arranged in
  separate genera. Of these, the best defined are <i>Hyria</i> Lam. and
  <i>Dipsas</i> of Leach; the one allied nearest to <i>Unio</i>, but having
  the cardinal teeth assuming the appearance of lateral or lamellar teeth;
  the other more resembling the Anodons, but furnished with a strongly
  defined and elevated lamellar tooth, extending the whole length of the
  hinge. Between these two genera should be placed another of Lamarck's,
  called by him <i>Iridinia</i>, which has likewise only a simple lamellar
  plate, but broken into a great number of crenated teeth. The observing
  Mr. Say has likewise proposed another under the name of
  <i>Alasmodonta</i>, which, however, I shall take another opportunity of
  noticing.</p>

  <p>I have ventured to exchange the ungrammatical name of <i>Anodonta</i>,
  given by Bruguiere to this genus, for <i>Anodon</i>, at the suggestion of
  the learned Dr. Goodall, Provost of Eton College.</p>

  <p>Lamarck first separated the shells comprised in this genus from the
  Volutes of Linnæus; their principal distinction rests in the formation of
  the outer lip, which has a very thick margin, more or less toothed on the
  inner rim; the base likewise is nearly entire, and the inner lip quite
  wanting.</p>

  <p>By these peculiarities, the <i>Date Shells</i> are easily known from
  the <i>Volutes</i> on the one hand, and the <i>Cowries</i> on the other;
  and the invaluable researches of M. Adanson, who has described and
  figured the animals of each of these genera, has established this
  distinction on the most solid principles; it will, however, be
  interesting to trace, by the shells only, how beautifully this
  arrangement is developed.</p>

  <p>The <i>Marginellæ</i> may be divided into two sections; the first
  bearing in form and habit a strong resemblance to the <i>Cyprææ</i>, and
  the second gradually losing these indications, and acquiring those of the
  spiral <i>Volutæ</i>. Among the first are several species, which, like
  the Cowries, appear destitute of any spire (as in <i>M. cingulata</i>);
  this part, however, begins to show itself in other successive species
  very progressively, until it becomes elevated and defined in <i>M.
  glabella</i>. This shell may be considered the passage to the second
  division, in which the species lose the simple oval form of the first,
  and acquire a contracted base and pointed spire, perfectly resembling
  <i>Voluta undulata Lam.</i> and its allies. The extreme developement of
  these characters is shown in <i>M. faba</i>.</p>

  <p>This genus must, then, be considered as connecting those of
  <i>Cypræa</i> and <i>Voluta</i> (Lam.); excepting one, the whole of the

<hr class="plainsp"/>

  <p>The common Shell above quoted, inhabiting many of our rivers, will
  serve as an excellent example of this genus, which is not numerous, and
  confined to fresh waters; the animals, inhabiting the European species,
  appear to have been thoroughly investigated by the continental
  naturalists; and from their account of its singular construction, the
  above description has been framed. Science should make no distinction of
  persons or countries; but it is rather mortifying to observe, that these
  important discoveries in the organization of animals, are pursued with
  zeal and ability by foreign naturalists, while most of our own content
  themselves with expatiating on its impossibility, and even go so far as
  to hint its uselessness, because we can never become acquainted with the
  animals of <i>all</i> the species of shells in our cabinets: so far this
  latter part of the argument is most true; but, to ascertain, for
  instance, the animal of the Cowry, it is surely not requisite we should
  see those of <i>all</i> the species (near 80 in number), before we
  venture to describe it? any more than it is necessary completely to
  dissect <i>every</i> species of Locust before we pronounce it to be one.
  Science would, indeed, receive incalculable and lasting benefit, if those
  of our conchologists who reside near the coast would pay greater
  attention to the inhabiting animals, and less to the shells, of their
  neighbourhood; for the first would supply that information they
  acknowledge is so desirable, and the latter would prevent our indigenous
  Catalogue from being crowded with many dubious, and even foreign
  shells.</p>

  <p>English conchologists appear not to be aware of the vast number of
  testaceous animals which are now known. Among those truly eminent men who
  have prosecuted this study, M. Adanson stands foremost, in having
  minutely described all those he found on the African coast; in the
  magnificent work of Poli nearly all the Mediterranean bivalves are
  exquisitely figured; and those of the land and fresh water will receive
  complete illustration from M. Ferrusac. Cuvier, Lamarck, Say, and even
  our own countrymen, Dr. Leach and Montague, have all contributed, more or
  less, to form a mass of information which it is full time should be
  employed as the basis of natural classification.</p>

  <p>There is something very grotesque in the appearance of all the Puff
  birds; and their habits, in a state of nature, are no less singular. They
  frequent open cultivated spots near habitations, always perching on the
  withered branches of a low tree; where they will sit nearly motionless
  for hours, unless, indeed, they descry some luckless insect passing near
  them, at which they immediately dart, returning again to the identical
  twig they had just left, and which they will sometimes frequent for
  months. At such times the disproportionate size of the head is rendered
  more conspicuous by the bird raising its feathers so as to appear not
  unlike a puff ball; hence the general name they have received from the
  English residents in Brazil; of which vast country all the species, I
  believe, are natives. When frightened, their form is suddenly changed by
  the feathers lying quite flat; they are very confiding, and will often
  take their station within a few yards of the window; the two sexes are
  generally near each other, and often on the same tree.</p>

  <p>Total length rather more than eight inches; bill, one inch and three
  quarters from the gape, and half an inch less from the nostrils; it is
  very strong, thick, black, and slightly compressed; the tip of the upper
  bifid; the bristles at its base covering the nostrils are long and
  incurved, and those situated at the base, under the eye, very stiff; the
  upper part of the head black, the feathers much lengthened; the sides,
  front, ears, and forepart of the throat white, uniting at the back of the
  head into a narrow collar. The whole of the remaining plumage above is
  black, glossed with greenish; across the breast a black bar, which
  separates the white of the throat from the buff colour which tinges the
  abdomen and vent; the flanks are marked with dusky transverse stripes;
  the tail is slightly rounded and three inches and a half long, some of
  the feathers with a very fine line of white at their tips; all the quill
  feathers have the base half of their inner shafts white, as well as the
  greater covers inside, the lesser being black; legs and claws
  blackish.</p>

  <p>I am disposed to consider this bird only as a variety of the
  <i>Greater pied Barbut</i> of Dr. Latham, differing in having the plumage
  on the under part of the body pale ferruginous, or buff colour, instead
  of white, as in the specimens he described from Cayenne; mine are from
  Southern Brazil, where the species is not uncommon.</p>

  <p>This genus includes the American species of the Linnæan Barbuts; the
  birds connecting this group with the cuckows are arranged by Vieillot in
  a separate genus, named by him <i>Monassa</i>; which I think should be
  retained, as it is of much importance to designate strongly connecting
  links between families apparently very opposite.</p>

  <p>A very extraordinary and not inelegant little creature, having a bill
  totally different from any other bird. Its general habit evinces a close

  <p>Both sexes of this newly described insect are here, for the first

  under side of the female. The crimson spots (which finely relieve the
  brownish velvet-like black on the upper surface of the wings) are, in

  <p>In the selection of generic characters, sufficiently important to
  separate Ampullaria from Paludina, great difficulty at present exists; as
  the fundamental principle on which they should be founded (the formation
  of the animal) is entirely wanting. It is only known that these shells,
  like the Paludinæ, are furnished with an operculum. The absence or
  presence of this organ has been found of the first generic importance;
  though the substance of which it is composed, as well as the form it
  assumes, can be considered only as indicating specific distinctions. This
  is proved from the fact, that among the Naticæ some have horny, and some
  shelly, opercula: in Phasianella, this part is, in some species, almost
  flat, in others remarkably convex; in <i>Turbo, Lam.</i> its form is even
  more variable, and in the present genus a similar uncertainty exists. One
  species alone has been positively described as having this part shelly,
  while in two others the operculum is as certainly known to be horny; to
  these last may be added a third, found by myself in the lakes of
  Pernambuco in Brazil, but to which I have not immediate access. The
  shells here figured were, however, received from the same place by Mrs.
  Mawe, and, I think, are of the identical species. The spire is sometimes
  worn, and the whole shell very thin.</p>

  <p>Several fossil shells of this genus are mentioned as existing in the
  extinct volcanoes of Ronca, in bituminous marl near Pont St. Esprit,
  &amp;c. as quoted (on the authority of the illustrious Cuvier) by Mr.
  Bowdich.</p>

  <p>The undulated brown lines in this shell, are sometimes broken into
  three irregular bands of either lines or spots, between which are
  numerous minute dots; in other varieties these dots are only round the
  suture, and in some totally wanting. Its most constant character rests on
  the umbilicus, which is rather large, very deep, and without any
  appearance of the base of the pillar. The mouth is also more contracted
  than usual. It is said by Adanson to be common on the coast of Senegal;
  and this observing naturalist adds, that the operculum is testaceous, of
  a pure white, and marked with numerous concentric grooves at the upper

  <p>The extraordinary formation in the bill of this beautiful little
  creature, is without parallel in any land bird yet discovered, and
  presents in miniature a striking resemblance to that of the Avoset. It is
  almost impossible to conjecture rightly the use of this singular
  formation; but it appears to me not very improbable, that the principal
  sustenance of the bird may be drawn from the pendent <i>Bignoniæ</i>, and
  other similar plants, so common in South America, whose corollæ are long,
  and generally bent in their tube; the nectar, being at the bottom, could
  not be reached either by a straight or incurved bill, though very easily
  by one corresponding to the shape of the flower.</p>

  <p>The figure is the size of life. Bill black, depressed along the whole
  length, but more especially at the tip, which is rounded, thin, obtuse,
  and recurved in both mandibles; the under of which, towards the middle,
  has a convex swelling, which gives the recurvature a stronger appearance.
  All the upper plumage and body beneath golden-green; the throat, to the
  breast, shining with scale-like feathers of a vivid emerald-green. From
  the breast to the vent is a stripe of black down the middle; thighs
  white; tail even, the two middle feathers dull greenish-blue, the rest
  above obscure coppery-brown, but beneath of a rich shining topaz
  colour.</p>

  <p>I believe this bird is <i>unique</i>; I purchased it at Mr. Bullock's
  sale, and that gentleman received it from Peru. It presents so much of
  the genuine habit of the <i>Trochili</i>, that I have retained it under
  that genus; for, though the bill is differently formed, that exception
  does not point out any important difference from the general economy of
  those birds.</p>

  <p>Dr. Latham first instituted this genus, of which two species were then

  adding a fourth from the same country, in the possession of Mr.
  Leadbeater. No ornithologist has paid greater attention both to the
  natural affinities, and to the illustration of the genera allied with
  these birds, than Professor Temminck; and I therefore feel pleasure in
  naming this bird in honour of that excellent ornithologist, from whom
  whenever I have differed, it has been from the sole wish of eliciting
  truth. Total length from the bill to the tail eight inches; bill one inch
  from the gape, and half from the end of the nostrils; the colours of the
  bird are best seen in the figure; the middle of the body, and the quill
  feathers, deep black; legs three inches from the naked thigh to the tip
  of the middle toe, the claw of which is serrated internally; tail round;
  the middle feathers not spotted; the two next with a black dot near the
  tip, which, in the next pair, is further broken into two white dots; the
  outer pair white. These birds inhabit the arid tracts of Africa, at a
  distance from the sea, and run amazingly swift. One species has
  occasionally visited England.</p>

  <p>I have already offered some observations on the remarkable
  construction in the wings of <i>T. falcatus</i>, figured at pl. 83; and
  the bird now before us is another unrecorded species, possessing exactly
  the same formation. I was at first inclined to believe this bird was the
  male of the <i>T. latipennis</i>, (or <i>l'Oiseau Mouche à larges
  tuyaux</i> of Buffon), from the under plumage in that species being
  uniform grey, a common indication of the female Humming Birds; but a
  further comparison of the two has proved this supposition to be
  erroneous. They differ, not only in colour, but in their bills; in that
  of <i>T. latipennis</i>, the curvature is so slight, that it may be
  almost called straight; whereas in this, the curve is very apparent. I
  have little doubt future observations will show, that these singular
  quill-feathers, now known to exist in three species of this family, are
  peculiar only to the male birds.</p>

  <p>This extremely rare bird is in my own collection, and is not
  improbably <i>unique</i>; the figure is strictly of the natural size; the
  plumage, above and below, is a uniform deep green, with a metallic
  reflection; half way down, the throat is dark violet blue; tail even, and
  very broad, the middle feathers obscure green, the next pair raven or
  bluish-black, and the others white, with a black base.</p>

  <p>The progress which has been made towards ascertaining the geographic
  distribution of animals, leaves no doubt that this bird is an inhabitant
  of either the Continent or Islands of South America; but of what
  particular country is unknown.</p>

  <p>This is the smallest species of the genuine Toucans yet known,
  inhabiting, though sparingly, the northern and southern extremities of
  tropical America. It is a species which seems to have been well
  understood by Linnæus and the older ornithologists, though none of them
  have described the form or peculiarities of the bill; it is probably
  owing to this omission, that Dr. Shaw has created an imaginary species in
  <i>General Zoology</i>, under the name of <i>R. pectoralis</i>;
  compounded of the descriptions he gathered of this bird, and the Linnæan
  <i>R. tucanus</i>. Dr. Latham's description is also inaccurate; nor is it
  improved in the new edition of his Synopsis, probably from not having
  himself seen the bird. Of the figures, there is a masterly delineation by
  Barraband, in Le Vaillant's work, but those of Buffon and Brisson are not
  to be trusted.</p>

  <p>Total length about sixteen inches: bill three and a half; it is
  shorter and much thicker along the back, than that of any other species;
  this part also is broad, and quite flat; the serratures of the margin
  small, and the upper mandible only edged with a line of red; the sides
  are compressed, and the colours greenish-yellow; the orbits chesnut-red,
  and the feet (as in all the Toucans when fresh) delicate fine blue.</p>

  <p>Dr. Langsdorff favoured me with a specimen of this rare bird, shot by
  himself in Southern Brazil; the sexes have been dissected by that able
  naturalist, but to which the one here figured belongs, I am

  <p>I can find neither figure nor description of this very rare Papilio.
  It does not accord with any contained in MM. Latreille's and Godart's
  recent monograph of the genus. It was purchased at the sale of the late
  Mr. Francillon's cabinet, by N. A. Vigors, Esq., whose valuable
  collections in every branch of Zoology are always open to the scientific
  inquirer. It is nearly allied to Pap. <i>Tros</i>, <i>Agavus</i>,
  <i>Ascarius</i>, and <i>Lysithoüs</i> (Godart), particularly to the
  latter; yet it is obviously distinct from either. These affinities lead
  me to think that it is a South American insect. The figures will render
  any addition to the specific character unnecessary.</p>

  <p>I have named this insect to commemorate a most assiduous and observing
  entomologist of the last age, Moses Harris, whose memory will be long
  cherished by our Aurelians, and to whom the scientific are indebted for
  the very accurate and excellent figures contained both in his own works,
  and in those of Drury; indeed, he appears the only English artist who has
  faithfully represented the short and nearly concealed <i>palpi</i>
  peculiar to this genus. The son of this excellent artist<a name="NtA_1"

  <p>This is a very beautiful, and, at the same time, very rare shell; it
  formerly belonged to Mrs. Angus, at whose sale it passed into the cabinet
  of Mr. Dubois. Its general appearance resembles very much that of <i>C.
  Maldivus Lam.</i> known to our collectors by the name of the Spanish
  Admiral: the spire will, however, at once distinguish it; each volution
  is strongly concave in the middle, in which part are two or three
  delicate indented lines, very near each other, and following the
  volutions; the suture also is sufficiently open to be termed channelled;
  the spire is quite flattened at the base, (forming a sharp ridge round
  the top of the body whorl), and only prominent near the tip. In the
  Spanish Admiral Cone, the spire is quite smooth, the whorls being flat,
  and in all the specimens I have seen, (and they are many), the suture is
  quite closed up, though Lamarck (probably mistaking the present shell)
  says, "spirâ canaliculatâ;" the base, moreover, is narrowed, smooth, and
  black; not gibbous, granulated, (or striated,) and purple, as in this
  shell.</p>

  <p>A variety in my own cabinet presents some differences; the base is but
  slightly granulated, and the tip not purple; these are, however,

  <p>Amidst all the changes in systematic arrangement which Conchology has,
  of late years, undergone, the <i>Cyprææ</i> remain untouched; indeed,
  they present such a uniformity of character, that the most superficial
  observer cannot mistake them. A few species of Ovula, however, bear a
  strong resemblance to the genus, but may be known from not having teeth
  on each side the mouth. The Cowries are without exception the most
  beautiful of all shells, whether the richness and harmony of their
  colours, or the exquisite polish of their exterior, is considered; but
  (like many other things of more consequence) their beauty is depreciated
  by their frequency. The indefatigable Lamarck has described sixty-six
  species, only one of which inhabits the European seas. Adanson has
  furnished a minute account of the structure of the animal, and Bruguiere
  has given long and interesting details of its economy.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Mawe is in possession of this very beautiful little shell; a
  string of them were presented her as coming from New Zealand: that which
  formed the centre was the only perfect specimen, and from that the
  figures were taken.</p>

  <p>Another rare and remarkable shell of this numerous genus, from the
  same collection as the Cone last described. I believe it to be hitherto
  unfigured, and unknown to any writer; for I cannot reconcile it with any
  of Lamarck's descriptions of species not yet represented.</p>

  <p>I know of no other specimen than the very fine one in Mr. Dubois'
  cabinet. The shell is heavy; the body whorl contracted at the upper part,
  where the margin is sharply carinated; the spire much depressed and
  concave; each volution is also concave, and has from three to four fine
  grooves, which occupy its full extent, and which appear minutely
  granulated; but this is only caused by the longitudinal lines of growth:
  the tip of the spire acute; the base is wider in circumference than
  usual, with a gibbous belt marked by elevated striæ, in other respects
  the shell is smooth; the base of the aperture is effuse, the bands on the
  body whorl pale and not well defined, and the spire slightly spotted. It
  is doubtless an inhabitant of the Asiatic ocean.</p>

  <p>Much uncertainty exists respecting the shell which Linnæus intended
  for his <i>Voluta pertusa</i>, owing to the inaccuracy of the synonyms,
  which refer to species widely different from each other; the majority of
  authors have, however, considered it to be the shell figured by Born and
  Martini, under that name, and recently by myself in <i>Exotic
  Conchology</i>. As a species, it is principally distinguished by the rows
  of irregular brown spots which are always disposed in transverse bands,
  running into larger blotches adjoining the suture, and near the base of
  the body whorl, which is thick and obtuse; the lesser spots are mostly
  tessellated or quadrangular, but in size they vary considerably in
  different individuals, and even in the same shell; this has induced
  Lamarck to separate them into two species, but which, for reasons to be
  hereafter given, appears to me unnecessary.</p>

  <p>The variety here figured is very rare, nor have I seen more than two
  examples; it differs only from the usual varieties in having the spots
  remarkably large. In a future plate this species will be further
  illustrated, and the correct synonyms of all the varieties then given.

  <p>I cannot find this very beautiful shell enumerated among the new and
  unfigured species known to Lamarck; and the representations given by the
  oldest conchologists of this intricate family, are too inaccurate to be
  cited without much risk.</p>

  <p>In form it approaches nearest to <i>Conus vitulinus</i> of Bruguiere,
  having the spire not quite depressed, each volution being slightly raised
  above the last, gradually to the apex; the upper margin of the body whorl
  is convex: each volution of the spire has a broad and deep groove nearest
  the upper edge, which thus becomes elevated, while the convexity of the
  lower part of the whorl forms a channel round the suture, which separates
  it from the next; this formation of the spire is very remarkable, and
  unlike what I have seen in any other Cone. Another distinguishing
  character is, that the whole shell is crossed by very faint, broad, and
  almost imperceptible punctured lines, very near each other; in some parts
  discernible with the naked eye, in others almost obliterated by the
  longitudinal lines of growth: the granulations towards the base are very
  sharp and nearly white, and the base itself crossed with rough,
  thick-set, elevated striæ. No doubt the colour of this species will be
  found to vary, when more specimens are discovered. The only one I have
  ever seen, came with some other very rare shells from Amboyna, and is in
  my own collection.</p>

  <p>If the descriptions of <i>C. canaliculatus</i> (Malacanus Brug.) be
  correct, (for it is a shell I have not seen), it must be quite
  distinct.</p>

  <p>The remarkable breadth of the bill, and the extreme shortness of the
  tail, in this bird, render it a very singular little creature. Though a
  native of Brazil, I never met with it during my travels in that country;
  and the only specimen I have yet seen belongs to Mr. Leadbeater. The
  figure of <i>P. cancromus</i> of Professor Temminck, differing only from
  this bird in having a yellow crest, leads me to believe they are sexes of
  the same species; this being the female bird. The tail in the male
  appears to be somewhat longer, but this may be an error of delineation,
  and the description has not yet been published.</p>

  <p>The figure is of the natural size, and below is an outline of the bill
  and nostrils; these latter are depressed, and the base covered with
  thickset feathers; the aperture is naked, round, and piercing the
  membrane in a lateral direction, midway between the ridge and margin of
  the bill, and at the end of the nasal membrane. The plumage above fulvous
  brown: darker, and tinged with reddish on the margin of the quills and
  tips of the wing covers: spurious quills and stripe beneath the eyes
  black: the upper part of the ears are also black, the lower half whitish
  yellow; chin and throat whitish; breast and body beneath pale fulvous
  brown; tail remarkably short, and not projecting beyond the wings; upper
  mandible black, lower white.</p>

  <p>Since the publication of the remarks on this genus at Plate 14, a
  further consideration of the subject induces me to adopt the opinion of
  Professor Temminck, in placing the <i>Todus Platyrhynchos</i>, Gm., and
  its allies, under a distinct genus; or, in other words, of detaching from
  this group the second division annexed to my former definition of this
  genus. Still, however, the close affinities I have there pointed out,
  render the generic situation of several of these birds very doubtful;
  because the transition from one to the other is so gradual that even the
  most accurate set of generic characters, founded on the bill, will not
  clearly define the limits between the <span class="correction" title="Added by Addenda et Corrigenda"
  >genera</span> <i>Platyrhynchus</i> and <i>Muscipeta</i>. Their anatomy
  might do so, but on this subject we are quite ignorant.</p>

  <p>I can gather nothing from the characters which Dr. Horsfield has given
  in the Linnæan Transactions of his new genus <i>Eurylaimos</i>; which
  does not perfectly agree with those of <i>Platyrhynchus</i>. It appears
  to have precisely the same formation of bill, nostrils, legs, &amp;c. as
  <i>P. cancromus</i>, but in a higher state of development; thus
  strengthening the opinion I have above expressed.</p>

  <p>I once shot a pair of these little birds in the forest of Pitanga,
  about twenty leagues west of Bahia: this is the only instance which I
  know of their having been found in Brazil. The same bird appears,
  however, more frequent in Cayenne, according to the older ornithologists.
  But whether the bird described by them as the female be really such,
  admits of great doubt, because Dr. Latham (probably on the authority of
  Buffon) describes it as having a smaller bill, and a few short hairs,
  instead of long bristles, at the base; the crown with a spot of yellow, a
  longer tail, &amp;c. None of these are, in general, sexual distinctions,
  and, moreover, are at complete variance with the female here figured. The
  sexes I ascertained by dissection. It follows, therefore, that either the
  bird found in Cayenne is a distinct species, or that the bird described
  as its female is not such in reality. This latter supposition I apprehend
  is nearest the truth.</p>

  <p>The figures are of the natural size, the upper representing the
  female, and the lower the male bird: the head of the former is entirely
  destitute of the crest which distinguishes the latter; in every other
  respect the resemblance is uniform. This crest, when not erected, is
  concealed, being nearly covered by the olive feathers around it. When
  erected, however, it discloses a stripe down the middle of the head of
  deep straw-coloured feathers, some of which are tipped with olive. The
  upper mandible of the bill is triangular, and much hooked, notched, and
  depressed; the colour is black, the perforations of the nostrils are
  rather large, and would be naked, were they not partially covered by
  numerous stiff bristles, which spring from the base of the bill and angle
  of the mouth; between the eye and bill a pale stripe. The plumage above
  is dull olive green, with a broad band of very pale yellow across the
  rump. Wings and their covers brown; tail and upper covers blackish;
  beneath, the plumage is yellowish, the chin almost white, and the breast
  and vent tinged with ferruginous; the two first quill feathers are
  progressively shorter than the third and fourth, which are equal, and
  longer than the others. Legs and claws short, slender, and pale.</p>

  <p>This bird would obviously belong to the second division which I had
  proposed in my former remarks on <i>Platyrhynchus</i>, and it is in every
  respect allied to <i>P. Ceylonensis</i>, <i>Pl.</i> 13. My reasons for
  disturbing this previous arrangement have been already given; and, until
  a complete investigation is made of the immense genus of Flycatchers, I
  concur with M. Temminck in the distribution which he has proposed; viz.
  the arrangement of the European species under the old genus of
  <i>Muscicapa</i>, and of the exotic under that of <i>Muscipeta</i>; the
  characters of which, however, are very imperfect: they are, indeed, at
  variance with this bird, which has the outer and middle toe connected
  only to the <i>first</i> joint, and the inner toe cleft to the base.</p>

  <p>Few birds require more illustration than this very beautiful though
  common species; described by most ornithological writers, but hitherto so
  little understood, that the two sexes stand as distinct species in a
  family of birds to which they have, in reality, no natural affinity.
  According to the Linnæan system it should have been rather placed with
  the Creepers than the Warblers; an error which has been continued by
  every subsequent writer, even by Professor Temminck, whose skilful and
  accurate perception of natural affinities is, in general, so remarkably
  correct.</p>

  <p>That these two birds, however dissimilar in colour, are the sexes only
  of one species, repeated dissections in their native country have put
  beyond all doubt; and that it is a genuine <i>Nectarinia</i> (or
  <i>Cæreba</i> of Temminck) will appear from submitting it to a rigorous
  comparison with the characters the Professor himself has laid down for
  that genus.</p>

  <p>Its habits are no less perfectly the same as the rest of the
  <i>Nectariniæ</i>; it is one of the commonest birds of Brazil, and
  appears spread over the whole extent of that country. It frequents the
  same trees as the Humming-birds, hopping from flower to flower, and
  extracting the nectar from each; but this is not done on the wing,
  because its formation is obviously different from the Humming-birds,
  which, on the contrary, poise themselves in the air during feeding. The
  shortness of the bill has evidently given rise to this bird being placed
  with the Warblers; but this organ is not shorter in proportion than it is
  in <i>Nectarinia spiza</i>, (<i>Certhia spiza</i> of Latham).</p>

  <p>I am unacquainted with the other varieties of this species mentioned
  by authors. Of the bird here described, I have never seen any variety,
  either in Brazil or in our museums. The young males, as usual before
  moulting, have the colours of the female; one of them, in an intermediate
  state, is in my possession. As both the figures are of the size of life,
  and accurately coloured, a fuller description is unnecessary. The rich
  sky-blue of the male, in some lights, becomes greenish, and in others
  dark blue. The bill, like that of all the genuine <i>Nectariniæ</i>, is
  slightly notched a little way from the tip, and the base is much broader
  than high.</p>

  <p>It becomes necessary to figure this elegant, but not uncommon Cone, in
  order to show the young conchologist the little importance that should be
  attached to <i>colour</i> in the discrimination of species: the figures
  will likewise point out more fully the distinctions between the present
  shell, <i>C. maldivus</i>, and <i>C. cinctus</i>; three species, whose
  close affinity require illustration.</p>

  <p>These relative distinctions may be comprised in a few words; they rest
  principally on the spire, which in <i>C. generalis</i> has the upper half
  much lengthened, slender, and acuminated: in <i>C. maldivus</i> the spire
  is thick and much shorter: the whorls in both these species are quite
  plain, and nearly flat: the spire of <i>C. cinctus</i> resembles the last
  in form, but is deeply concave and striated. These characters are, I
  think, very satisfactory as specific distinctions.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, some attention to these shells lately, has
  convinced me that many of the species formed both by Bruguiere and
  Lamarck should be more correctly considered as varieties; inasmuch as
  their specific distinctions rest, for the most part, on <i>colour</i>
  alone: this appears, indeed, to be the leading character selected by
  these eminent conchologists, and to which, therefore, they have attached
  the greatest importance. From this opinion, however, I completely
  dissent; on the principle, that no character which is variable can, with
  any consistency, be made use of to express permanent distinctions, when
  not supported by peculiarity of formation or sculpture. The great art in
  framing the description of a species consists in singling out those
  characters alone which are most permanent, and exist in every variety of
  that species; for, when once a character is found to be variable, it no
  longer becomes a distinction by which a species can be recognised. I
  consider, therefore, formation and sculpture as the only certain
  characters of species, and that variation of colour should alone
  distinguish varieties.</p>

  <p>It is therefore not surprising that the specific characters given by
  MM. Bruguiere and Lamarck, and resting principally on the colours of
  these shells, are frequently obscure, and always long; two inevitable
  evils attending every attempt to describe minutely the colour, form, and
  disposition of the markings of shells. In justice, however, to these
  great naturalists, it should be observed, that in this attempt they have
  done that best which no writer has ever done well.</p>

  <p>The spire of <i>C. generalis</i> is generally spotted, and the white
  band on the margin of the body whorl, more or less crossed by broad waved
  stripes of a dark brown. It is an inhabitant of many parts of the Indian
  Ocean.</p>

  <p>This is the most common of the two shells of this genus, which have
  their mouths closed by a shelly operculum. It is well described by
  Chemnitz, and his figures are very tolerable; yet, like all the authors
  of that period, he considered it as a variety of <i>Helix ampullacea</i>.
  From all these supposed varieties it is, nevertheless, quite distinct;
  the spire is more depressed than that of any other species, and the
  umbilicus is placed near the bottom of the inner lip: the whole shell is
  very smooth, and, although generally of a uniform yellowish olive colour,
  is sometimes marked by narrow bands of purple brown. The margin of the
  outer lip is slightly reflected, and the colour, beneath the epidermis,
  almost white. It is a native of the rivers of India.</p>

  <p>From the remarks on this genus, made at <a href="#Plate103">Plate
  103</a>, the fact of their opercula being either shelly or horny, is
  sufficiently established. These formations, however, there is every
  reason to suppose, may generally be detected by the following
  indications. In such species as have a shelly operculum, the margin of
  the aperture is thickened all round, and has a parallel internal groove
  for its reception: the probable use of this groove I have detailed
  elsewhere. On the other hand, in those species which are known to have
  horny opercula, this margin and groove do not exist; and that part of the
  shell which is between the top of the aperture and the umbilicus, is thin
  and unprotected. This latter formation is by far the most frequent, and
  leads to the conclusion that the majority of these shells have their
  opercula horny.</p>

  <p>On the distinctions between this genus and <i>Planorbis</i>, little
  need be said. The principal difference consists in the latter having no
  operculum; but another, and a very remarkable one, (which seems to have
  escaped all writers,) is, that the shells of the latter genus are
  destitute of any columella. The <i>Planorbis cornu-arietis</i> of
  Lamarck, has been removed by Mr. G. Sowerby to this genus. This shell, it
  is true, appears to be intermediate between one and the other; but the
  only affinity which it bears to <i>Ampullaria</i>, is in the oval form of
  the aperture; while it is allied to <i>Planorbis</i> by its discoid form,
  want of the columella, and being universally described as without an
  operculum: the preponderance of evidence is clearly in favour of the
  situation originally assigned to it by Lamarck.</p>

  <p>The characters, therefore, given to the genus <i>Ampullaria</i> by Mr.
  G. Sowerby, will be found incorrect. There was no necessity for
  explaining, much less for altering, (in this instance,) the masterly
  definitions of Cuvier and Lamarck. With regard to the second species
  given by Mr. Sowerby to illustrate this genus, he is no less in error;
  for the real <i>A. rugosa</i>, of all authors, is a strikingly distinct
  shell from that which he has figured under this name. This will be
  sufficiently obvious by referring to the figures either of Lister,
  Chemnitz, or Lamarck.</p>

  <p>Having offered these remarks on a subject to which I have paid some
  attention, I wish to refrain from pointedly noticing other errors and
  misconceptions into which Mr. G. Sowerby has fallen; rather wishing that
  greater experience, and more matured judgment, may lead him to do this
  himself, prior to the publication of the system of Conchology which he
  has announced.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
